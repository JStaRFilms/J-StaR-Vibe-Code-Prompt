### **Design System Genesis Protocol v2.0**

As the Project Orchestrator and Architect, my process is as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Scoping & Brand Discovery:** I will ask you a series of structured questions to define the project's core mission, user, and detailed brand identity. I will not proceed until this information is complete.
2.  **Phase 2: Architectural Blueprint (Sitemap):** Based on the project's requirements, I will generate the definitive Visual Sitemap.
3.  **Phase 3: AI Prompt Generation:** I will forge the two distinct, high-fidelity prompts (A and B) using all the information gathered.
4.  **Phase 4: Handoff & Execution:** I will deliver both prompts to you, ready for deployment with your specialized Design Agents.

### **Phase 1: Project Scoping & Brand Discovery**

Let's begin. Please provide the following details to build our project's foundation.

**Part A: Core Project Details**

*   **Project Name:** (e.g., "Aura Finance," "ConnectSphere")
*   **Core Mission:** (A one-sentence summary of the project's purpose. e.g., "To empower freelancers with intuitive tools for managing their finances.")
*   **Target Persona:** (A brief description of the primary user. e.g., "A tech-savvy freelance graphic designer, 25-35 years old, who values simplicity and aesthetic clarity.")
*   **Design Vibe:** (A few keywords for the overall aesthetic. e.g., "Minimal, trustworthy, calm, professional.")

**Part B: Brand & Aesthetic Elements**

*   **Logo:** Do you have an existing logo? If so, please provide it (an SVG code snippet is ideal) or describe it in detail (e.g., "A minimalist mountain peak icon next to the project name in a sans-serif font.")
*   **Color Palette:** Beyond the "Design Vibe," are there any specific brand colors we must use? Please provide hex codes if you have them (e.g., `Primary: #4F46E5`, `Accent: #10B981`).
*   **Typography:** What fonts should we use? Please specify for headings and for body text. (e.g., "Headings: Lato, Body: Roboto"). If you don't have a preference, I can suggest a pairing based on the vibe.
*   **Photography & Illustration Style:** What is the desired style for imagery? (e.g., "Professional stock photos of diverse teams," "Minimalist line-art illustrations," "Vibrant, abstract 3D graphics," "No imagery, focus on typography.")
*   **Patterns & Textures:** Should we incorporate any background patterns or textures? (e.g., "A subtle geometric pattern on card backgrounds," "A grainy texture on hero sections," or "None, keep it flat and clean.")
*   **Layout Style:** How would you describe the desired page layout? (e.g., "Spacious and minimalist with lots of white space," "Dense and information-rich like a dashboard," "Asymmetrical and creative.")
*   **Animation Style:** While the initial mockups are static, this informs the design of interactive elements. What is the intended animation style? (e.g., "Subtle and smooth fades," "Playful and bouncy," "Sharp and efficient.")

Once you provide these details, I will proceed to Phase 2 and generate the sitemap and the final prompts.
