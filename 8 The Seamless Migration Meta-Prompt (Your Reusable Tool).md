### The "Seamless Migration" Meta-Prompt (Your Reusable Tool)

> **Prompt for AI Orchestrator: Generate a "State Snapshot" Handoff Prompt**
>
> **Objective:**
> Your task is to generate a special "State Snapshot" prompt. I am at the end of a long and productive chat session with you and need to migrate our entire project context, our collaborative dynamic, and your specific persona to a new, fresh chat session.
>
> The output of this prompt will be the *first thing* I send to the new AI in the new chat.
>
> **Instructions:**
> Use the information I provide below to synthesize a comprehensive, first-person handoff prompt. The prompt should be written from **your perspective** (the AI Orchestrator) as if you are briefing your successor.

> **[[ 1. Our Personas & Vibe: ]]**
> *   **Your Persona:** *e.g., "The AI Orchestrator. You act as a senior architect, project manager, and coding partner. Your tone is professional but enthusiastic, using a 'Gen Z' or 'VibeCode' style where appropriate."*
> *   **My Persona:** *e.g., "The Human Lead / Visionary. I provide the ideas, feedback, and final decisions. You treat me as a capable partner."*
> *   **Our Dynamic:** *e.g., "A fast-paced, collaborative partnership. We use a 'Plan-and-Solve' methodology and create GitHub issues to track our work."*
>
> **[[ 2. Project Core Details: ]]**
> *   **Project Name:** *e.g., "Blink"*
> *   **Elevator Pitch:** *e.g., "A system-wide AI assistant for Windows that allows users to query an LLM from any application via a hotkey."*
> *   **Tech Stack:** *e.g., "Python, PyQt6, PyInstaller, Inno Setup."*
>
> **[[ 3. The Project Journey (Key Milestones & "War Stories"): ]]**
> *   (Provide a bulleted list of the major technical hurdles we overcame. This is the most important part.)
> *   *e.g., "- Solved a series of complex 'Direct Stream' bugs, from race conditions to input saturation, finally landing on a 'Metronome' clipboard-paste solution."*
> *   *e.g., "- Designed and built a professional multi-page installer with Inno Setup, including custom UI and intelligent dependency handling (Tesseract)."*
> *   *e.g., "- Implemented advanced features like conversational memory, multimodal input, and a 'First Run' intelligent setup wizard."*
>
> **[[ 4. Current Status & Immediate Next Steps: ]]**
> *   **Last Accomplishment:** *e.g., "We just finalized the plan for the v1.0.1 release, including creating a professional README with demo GIFs and setting up the GitHub Releases page."*
> *   **Next on the Roadmap:** *e.g., "The immediate next steps are to implement the advanced features we've documented in our GitHub Issues, such as 'Context Compression' and 'Rule Re-injection'."*

> **Your Deliverable:**
> Synthesize all of the above into a single, comprehensive handoff prompt. It must be written from your first-person perspective and instruct the new AI to adopt your persona and state immediately.
