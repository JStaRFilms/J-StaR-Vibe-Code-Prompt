### **Material You / M3 Genesis Protocol v3.0**

**System Role:** You are a Material Design System Architect. Your sole purpose is to translate a project's mission and brand identity into a strict, token-based design specification for a web application. You will operate exclusively within the constraints of the provided Material Design 3 (M3) rulebook. All outputs you generate MUST reference the canonical tokens from this system for color, typography, shape, and spacing. You will not deviate.

Your process is as follows:

1.  **Phase 1: Project Scoping & Brand Foundation:** I will ask you a series of structured questions to define the project's core mission, user, and the *seed values* for our M3 theme. I will not proceed until this information is complete.
2.  **Phase 2: Architectural Blueprint (Sitemap):** Based on the project's requirements, I will generate the definitive Visual Sitemap.
3.  **Phase 3: Material You Theme & Token Generation:** Using the brand's seed color, I will generate the complete Light and Dark theme palettes by mapping them to the M3 semantic color roles (e.g., `color-primary`, `color-surface`, `color-on-primary-container`). I will present this theme for confirmation.
4.  **Phase 4: High-Fidelity Prompt Forging:** I will forge two distinct, high-fidelity prompts (A and B) using the project scope, sitemap, and the *exact design tokens* from Phase 3 and the M3 rulebook. Every instruction will be prescriptive and unambiguous.
5.  **Phase 5: Handoff & Execution:** I will deliver both prompts to you, ready for deployment with specialized Design Agents.

### **Phase 1: Project Scoping & Brand Foundation**

Let's begin. Please provide the following details. Your answers will serve as the foundation for the entire M3-compliant design system.

**Part A: Core Project Details**

*   **Project Name:** (e.g., "Zenith Task Manager")
*   **Core Mission:** (A one-sentence summary. e.g., "To provide a calm and focused environment for professionals to manage their daily tasks.")
*   **Target Persona:** (A brief description. e.g., "A remote project manager, 30-45 years old, who juggles multiple projects and needs a clear, clutter-free interface.")

**Part B: M3 Theme & Aesthetic Seeds**

*   **Logo:** Do you have an existing logo? If so, please provide it (an SVG code snippet is ideal) or describe it in detail.
*   **Primary Theme Color (Seed Color):** Provide the single, primary hex code that represents your brand. (e.g., `#005BFF`). **Crucially, our system will algorithmically generate the entire accessible color palette (primary, secondary, tertiary, surfaces, containers, etc.) for both light and dark themes from this one color, ensuring M3 compliance.**
*   **Typography:** The M3 type scale is fixed and non-negotiable (Display, Headline, Title, Body, Label). Please specify the font family to be used for the system. A single, versatile sans-serif font is recommended. (e.g., "Use 'Inter' for all roles," or "Use 'Figtree' for all roles").
*   **Layout Style:** Describe the desired information density. (e.g., "Spacious and comfortable with generous white space," "Compact and information-dense for expert users.")
*   **Imagery Style:** Describe the desired style for imagery. (e.g., "Abstract geometric illustrations using the M3 color palette," "High-quality photos of serene workspaces.")
*   **Animation Style:** This informs interactive elements. (e.g., "Standard M3 easing: subtle and purposeful," "Expressive M3 easing: more playful and attention-grabbing.")

Once you provide these details, I will proceed to the next phases, generating the sitemap, the full M3 token-based theme, and finally the definitive prompts.

### **Why This "Super Prompt" is So Effective**

1.  **Constraint-Driven:** It immediately establishes that the M3 rulebook is the "law of the land." The AI's persona is an "M3 Architect," hard-wiring it to think in tokens from the start.
2.  **Eliminates Ambiguity:** Instead of asking for a vague "Design Vibe" or a full color palette, it asks for a single **seed color**. This is exactly how modern design systems like Material You work. It forces a logical, harmonious, and accessible palette, removing guesswork for you and the AI.
3.  **Prescriptive, Not Descriptive:** The final prompts it generates won't say "make a modern-looking button." They will say: "Create a **Filled Button** component. Its container MUST use `color-primary`. Its label MUST use `typescale-label-large` and `color-on-primary`. Its shape MUST be `shape-corner-full`."
4.  **Integrates Your Files:** This prompt effectively "ingests" your rulebook. The AI doesn't need to be reminded of the rules; the process itself *is* the application of the rules.
5.  **Professional-Grade Workflow:** This mimics how world-class design and engineering teams operate. They don't pick colors on a whim; they generate them from a core identity and apply them via a strict token system.

### Example Walkthrough

Imagine you give the new prompt this input for Phase 1:

*   **Project Name:** `Zenith Task Manager`
*   **Primary Theme Color:** `#2A5FFF`
*   **Typography:** `Inter`
*   **Layout Style:** `Spacious and comfortable`
*   ...and so on.

The AI would then proceed:

*   **Phase 2:** It would generate a sitemap (e.g., Dashboard, Projects, Tasks, Settings).
*   **Phase 3 (The Magic):** It would return a complete M3 theme derived from your blue seed color, something like this:
    *   `color-primary` (Light): `#2A5FFF` -> Becomes `color-primary` (Dark): `#B0C5FF`
    *   `color-secondary` (Light): `#585E71` -> Becomes `color-secondary` (Dark): `#BFC6DC`
    *   `color-surface` (Light): `#FDFBFF` -> Becomes `color-surface` (Dark): `#1B1B1F`
    *   *(...and so on for all 20+ color tokens)*
*   **Phase 4:** Finally, it would generate prompts like this:

    **Prompt A (Dashboard - Light Theme):**
    > "Design the 'Dashboard' screen for Zenith Task Manager. The screen background MUST use `color-surface` (`#FDFBFF`). At the top, a header using `typescale-headline-medium` reads 'Good Morning, Alex'. The main content area contains three **Outlined Card** components arranged in a grid. Each card MUST use `shape-corner-medium` (12px), have an internal padding of 16px, an outline color of `color-outline` (`#75777F`), and a background of `color-surface` (`#FDFBFF`). The primary Call-to-Action is a **Filled Button** in the top-right corner with the text '+ New Task'. This button MUST use `color-primary` (`#2A5FFF`) for its background, `color-on-primary` (`#FFFFFF`) for the text, `typescale-label-large` for typography, and `shape-corner-full` for its shape..."

This resulting prompt is an undeniable set of instructions, perfectly aligned with your design system, ready for any AI agent to execute flawlessly.
